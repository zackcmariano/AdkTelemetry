> **Turn any Google-ADK Agent into a Root Agent - instantly.**

Oraicle-Agent is a **groundbreaking Python library** that extends the Google Agent Development Kit (Google-ADK), enabling **any agent to become a `root_agent` dynamically**, without hacks, forks, or duplicated apps.

This unlocks a **new architectural paradigm** for multi-agent systems:
- Multiple conversational entrypoints
- Direct chat with sub-agents
- True Agent-to-Agent (A2A) orchestration
- Seamless deployment on **Vertex AI Agent Engine**

---

## 🚀 Why Oraicle-Agent exists

Google-ADK assumes:
- One `root_agent` per application
- Sub-agents can’t be direct entrypoints
- One conversational domain per deployment

**Oraicle-Agent breaks this limitation - intentionally and cleanly.**

With Oraicle-Agent, **any agent can become the root of a conversation**, while still participating in a larger A2A system.

> 🔥 This is not a hack.  
> 🔥 This is not a fork.  
> 🔥 This is a new abstraction layer.

## ✨ What makes Oraicle-Agent unique?

### ✅ Dynamic Root Agents
Choose *at runtime* which agent owns the conversation.

### ✅ Direct Sub-Agent Chat
Users can talk directly to a specialized agent (teacher, assistant, expert) **without losing context isolation**.

### ✅ A2A-First Architecture
Root agents orchestrate other agents, while still being callable as standalone conversational entities.

### ✅ Google-ADK & Vertex AI Compatible
Works with:
- `adk web`
- ADK loader
- Vertex AI Agent Engine

## 🧩 The core idea (one line)

> **Any `Agent` can be a `root_agent` if it is explicitly declared as one.**

Oraicle-Agent formalizes this idea.

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install oraicle
```

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

```python
from oraicle import autoagent
from google.adk.agents import Agent

history_teacher = Agent(
    name="history_teacher",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    instruction="You are a history teacher."
)

autoagent(history_teacher)
```

---

## ☁️ Deploying to Vertex AI Agent Engine

```python
from app.sub_agents.history_teacher.agent import history_teacher
```

---

## 🔧 Using Tools with Oraicle-Agent

Oraicle-Agent provides **automatic runtime discovery of tools**, allowing sub-agents to use tools **without importing directly from** `app.tools`.

This ensures:
- No PYTHONPATH hacks
- No custom bootstrap commands
- Full compatibility with adk web ./sub_agents
- Clean, scalable architecture

## 📁 Recommended project structure
```bash
app/
├── tools/
│   ├── student_exam.py
│   ├── register_student_grades.py
│   └── any_new_tool.py
│
└── sub_agents/
    └── history_teacher/
        ├── agent.py
        └── prompt.py
```

Each tool should live inside `app/tools` and expose public functions
(optionally using `__all__`).

### ✅ Importing tools inside sub-agents (correct way)
Instead of importing tools directly from app.tools, always import them from oraicle.tools.

❌ **Do NOT do this**
```python
from app.tools.student_exam import student_exam
from app.tools.register_student_grades import register_student_grades
```
### ✅ Do this
```python
from oraicle.tools import student_exam, register_student_grades
```
Oraicle-Agent will **automatically discover and load all tools inside** `app/tools` **at runtime**.

### ⚡ Example: Sub-agent using tools
```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from oraicle import autoagent
from oraicle.tools import student_exam, register_student_grades
from .prompt import AGENT_PROMPT

history_teacher = Agent(
    name="history_teacher",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-lite",
    instruction=AGENT_PROMPT,
    tools=[
        student_exam,
        register_student_grades,
    ],
)

autoagent(history_teacher)
```
No additional configuration is required.

## 🚀 Running locally with ADK
Oraicle-Agent works with the **default ADK command**, no bootstrap needed:
```bash
adk web ./sub_agents
```
All sub-agents will:
- Be discovered automatically
- Act as independent root_agents
- Have full access to shared tools
- Maintain isolated conversational contexts


## 🧠 Why this matters
This design turns `app/tools` into a **runtime tool registry**, not a static import dependency.
You get:
- True plug-and-play tools
- Zero coupling between app and sub-agents
- A clean A2A + Tooling architecture
- Production-safe execution (local & Vertex AI)
